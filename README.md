        <h1 class="Heading1">Why Maana?</h1>
        <p class="BodyText">The core of the Maana Knowledge Platform™ is its patented Computational Knowledge Graph™. The Maana Knowledge Graph is unique in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlike traditional “semantic” systems, the Knowledge Graph does not rely exclusively on ontologies and description logics. Instead, the Knowledge Graph separates the structure of data from the content itself. This separation enables a fluidity of modeling, allowing data from any source and in any format to be seamlessly integrated, modeled, searched, analyzed, operationalized and re-purposed.</li>
            <li>The data remains at the source and only the most relevant data in the context of what is being optimized is indexed and brought into the graph.</li>
            <li>Each resulting model is a unique combination of three key components – subject matter expertise, relevant data from silos, and the right algorithm – all of which are instrumental in optimizing assets and decision flows.</li>
            <li>The Maana Computational Knowledge Graph is also dynamic.  Nodes, which represent concepts in Maana’s graph are not static containers; they are computational vessels that allow for algorithms to be stored and executed. These algorithms could be as simple as pulling in new data from an external source, to as complicated as classification of documents through machine learning. As data is updated in real-time at the source, so are the nodes and the computational models that act on that data.  This allows for far more complex relationships to be modeled, and facilitates the ability of the graph to understand the connections between concepts, rather than just strings in data. Ultimately this is used for optimizing decisions or operations.</li>
            <li>Reusable Models<ul><li>The flexibility of the Maana Knowledge Graph enables groups across the organization to leverage and build-upon models created by other groups, dramatically accelerating the speed at which models are created throughout the organization.  These models are dynamic, and once operationalized into line-of-business applications, they learn and adapt based on the user’s behaviors and provide continuous intelligence for day-to-day operations.</li><li>The Maana Computational Knowledge Graph™ at the core of the platform is a network of models that are built using machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence that power AI-Driven Applications used to digitize decision support and operations.</li><li>It allows the knowledge of the business to be incrementally captured and grown, becoming more sophisticated as more projects are developed using it.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText">The MAANA knowledge platform offers a new way to get more out of machine learning and artificial intelligence projects and is the fastest way to digitize your business.</p>
