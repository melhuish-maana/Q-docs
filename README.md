        <h2>Visualize and Curate a Kind</h2>
        <p class="BodyText">As a best practice, once an initial CKG was created from one or more uploaded files, we recommend that the Business Analyst follows a curation process to visualize and validate the kinds and the suggested relations among them to identify and correct any unintended errors that would otherwise propagate downstream and negatively impact decision-making.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">A Maana Interpreted Kind appear in 2 different shapes within the CKG: Compact (default) and Expanded</p>
        <p class="BodyText">NOTE: will remove below kind shape once we get clarity on how we represent kidn status (green =ready to use, yellow= processing, red/pink= needs curation/attention)</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Mini Representation –  insert green dot</p>
        <p class="BodyText">In the Mini Representation the kind is represented as colored dot. The color of the dot provides info on the kind status</p>
        <p class="BodyText">● Green: Kind is Ready and available for use</p>
        <p class="BodyText">● Orange (animated): Busy, work in progress, Kind is still being processed</p>
        <p class="BodyText">● Pink: Kind needs curation</p>
        <p class="BodyText">No parser found</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Hovering the mouse above a kind displayed in Mini mode shows the name of the kind and …. number of IN and OUT relations with other kinds.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Compact Representation–</p>
        <p class="BodyText">&#160;</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Insert pic of compact only from above.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The Compact representation of a kind includes the following elements:</p>
        <p class="BodyText">•	Kind name</p>
        <p class="BodyText">•	IN – relations connector at the kind level - shows incoming relations into the kind.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">•	OUT- relations connector at the kind level - shows outgoing relations / dependencies TO other kinds</p>
        <p class="BodyText">•	Down-arrow – clicking on the down arrow changes the representation of the kind from Compact mode to the Expanded mode.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Expanded Representation–</p>
        <p class="BodyText">&#160;</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Insert pic of higher res Interpreted kind instead of this one.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The Expaded representation of a kind includes the following elements:</p>
        <p class="BodyText">•	Kind name</p>
        <p class="BodyText">•	IN – relations connector at the kind level - shows incoming relations into the kind.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">•	OUT- relations connector at the kind level - shows outgoing relations / dependencies TO other kinds</p>
        <p class="BodyText">•	List of entities within that kind.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">•	IN – relations connector at the entity level - shows incoming relations into the kind or entities within those kinds.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">•	OUT- relations connector at the entity level - shows outgoing relations / dependencies TO other kinds or entities within those kinds</p>
        <p class="BodyText">•	Up-arrow – clicking on the up arrow changes the representation of the kind from Expanded mode to the Compact mode.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The way the kind is presented in the canvas space does not affect its functionality.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The user can cycle between kinds</p>
        <p class="BodyText">appear by clicking on the colored dot within the kind box, thus reducing clutter and focusing on the kinds he is working it.</p>
