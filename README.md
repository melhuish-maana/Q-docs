        <h1 class="Heading1">What Is Maana?</h1>
        <p class="BodyText">In 2013 Maana invented a new way to represent industrial knowledge mathematically, using the Maana Patented Computational Knowledge Graph™.  This unique technology enables industrial companies to encode human expertise and data from across silos into digital knowledge to help employees make better and faster decisions.  The Maana Computational Knowledge Graph™ is a network of models that optimize specific operations and decisions flows by providing recommendations through AI-Driven Applications into those operations. This unique technology eliminates the need to move data and enables creation of thousands of models at scale, through the re-usability of models across the enterprise.
